# Ontario Tech Casino – INFR3120 Final Project (Part III)

This repository contains our INFR3120 final project, **Ontario Tech Casino**.

It is a small casino-style web app where users can:

- Register and log in
- Deposit and withdraw **fake** money into a wallet
- Play games such as **Ride The Bus** and **Blackjack**
- Navigate through a simple dashboard / feature page
- Contact the “team” via a Contact Us form

The tech stack is:

- **Node.js + Express** for the server
- **EJS** templates for the views
- **MongoDB Atlas** + Mongoose for storing users and wallet balances
- **express-session** for authentication
- Deployed using a cloud provider as required for the course

## notes on commit history and why it might look unusual 
---

This is a first time collaboration using github and the commits are not accurate.
---
At november 13/25 when I commited all these (index page, header and footer, register, and css) with no changes because I commited them earlier on in the day (hours before). But when Alex did his next commit it delted all of my old ones. So i re-commited them with no changes but they still show up as a commit under my name (so you know what work i did).

full read me with all documentation is in the works. will be available at a later date. 

Thank you 
The Developers
