# Final_Project Casino Website

---
This is a first time collaboration using github and the commits are not accurate.
---
At november 13/25 when I commited all these (index page, header and footer, register, and css) with no changes because I commited them earlier on in the day (hours before). But when Alex did his next commit it delted all of my old ones. So i re-commited them with no changes but they still show up as a commit under my name (so you know what work i did).
